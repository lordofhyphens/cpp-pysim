random/greedy partition method:

1) pick a primary output
2) add its fanins to the partition
3) Continue adding fanins until max W is hit. 
3.1) If a gate is already in a partition, don't add it.
3.2) If PO is only member of parition, add it to its fanin's partition instead.
4) pick another primary output. 
5) If no more viable POs, pick a node at random that is not in a partition, treat its output as a PO (add BSC).
